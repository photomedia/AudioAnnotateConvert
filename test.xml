  <div label="[inaudible] In view of the embarrassment of having made such a mess of introducing the last poet, I spent a considerable amount of time setting out what I should say this evening, so hopefully I'll be a little more successful. Well, this is our seventh poetry evening and we welcome you all here this cold and blustery evening. Now, this evening we're having Margaret Avison read poems, and I wanted to say a few things about her. I first listened to Margaret read her poems at the poetry conference, University of British Columbia, during the summer of 1963. Her reading, together with those of the other poets on hand, are among the most memorable occasions I've had in my love affair with poems and poets. Four years later, in early January, we spent an afternoon together. Now I don't want to attribute, what I felt with a thought, on Bloor Street, to our conversation, but the warmth of it was very real. Margaret Avison was born in Guelph, Ontario; some early years were spent in Alberta; she graduated from Victoria College, the University of Toronto, in 1940, with a BA in English Language and Literature. She has been a secretary of all sorts for various firms, individuals, and organizations, and has also been a research assistant and librarian and presently teaches English at Scarborough College, Toronto. 1956-57 she was a Guggenheim Fellow in poetry, and during the forties her work appeared in various Canadian magazines, and in the fifties, mainly in American ones. She has published two books of poems; The Winter Sun in 1960 won the Governor General's Award, and in 1966, W.W. Norton in New York issued The Dumbfounding, her latest book. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure in introducing to you Margaret Avison.">

  <div label="I don't know about the reading but I do know about the pleasure of meeting Roy again here, and being introduced by him. If this were Monday, or up to a week from tonight, I would be able to join the Angry Art Week. I don't know if anybody else has received these letters, but in New York City initially they're trying this and anybody who gets a letter from them is asked to dedicate any reading or event to what they're trying to do. You can still send them money, too, I'll give you the address if you want it later. What they're going to do is play harps in railroad stations and have...lets see, Bach cantatas in railroad stations, play-ins in various museums and the lobbies of concert halls, recital halls, business buildings--I like that one--dramatic presentations in laundromats and supermarkets [laughter], a paint-in, and fences and billboards throughout Manhattan with their work showing and so on. This is a series. &quot;What we're trying to do is through art to reach the American people as human beings.&quot; So....[laughter] if this were Monday I'd dedicate the reading...This is all very orderly, although it doesn't look it, and it starts with other people's poems of various kinds. A little section of C. Bukowski, somebody said that's Charles, an American poet. It's a great long thing that was in a Mimeograph magazine, and the description is of a woman with a bicycle and a baby carriage, high-heeled shoes, white socks, and all her belongings, on hot day in the middle of a road in a city.">

  <div label="That's sad, so on the same page I copied one of Al Fowler's, which was in a magazine called Lines, which is the all-time happiest little poem, and I don't know why. I'm going to stop where the lines stop, not where the sense stops, so you can see the shape of it. There's no capital letters. There's not title.">

  <div label="I may bring in some more of other people's, but this is just a little, it's a friend of mine in Toronto who's made it to grade seven this year. He calls it &quot;The Delinquent,&quot; and he has, in this copy he has said that it's his copyright so if you betray the fact that I read some of it, I'll be in trouble with him.">
